        As the title suggests, my name is Eli Olcott. I am 16 years old, and I am going to be a junior at Lexington High School fall of 2021. 
        Personally, I've always had a passion for coding ever since I started in 7th grade. 
        The ability to create whatever I wanted had always been enticing, and I believe coding gives you that ability. So, I am glad I am taking this <span class="Stanford">Stanford</span> course on
        client side web programming as I believe it will help me achieve more within my programming career. Thus, I hope <span class="Stanford">Stanford</span> continues to allow high schoolers to enter
        these classes to continue to learn. Particularly if their high schools can't afford the resources to teach the subject.

        Although I love coding, I do have a lot of other interests as well. I love to play soccer which I have been playing since I was three. I have also always enjoyed working out
        as pushing my body to its limits has always been something I have loved to do. I also enjoy reading, particularly science fiction and different perspectives of what our future
        could look like. As technology advances seeing the different plausibilities of what could happen has always captured my imagination in a gripping way. Though these are my 
        some of my favorite hobbies, they are not all of them.
